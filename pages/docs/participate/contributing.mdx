# Contributing Guide

### Working With GitHub

GitHub allows you to make changes to a project using git, and later submit them
in a "pull request" so they can be reviewed and discussed. In order to use
GitHub, you need to [sign up](http://github.com/signup) and [set up
git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git). You will also need to
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the cyberyen.org repository
from its [GitHub page](https://github.com/cyberyen-org/cyberyen.org) and clone
your GitHub repository into a local directory with the following command lines:

```
git clone (url provided by GitHub on your fork's page) cyberyen.org
cd cyberyen.org
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cyberyen-org/cyberyen.org.git
```

### How to send a pull request

1. Checkout to your master branch. `git checkout master`
2. Create a new branch from the master branch. `git checkout -b (any name)`
3. Edit files and preview the result.
4. Track changes in files. `git add -A`
5. Commit your changes. `git commit -m '(short description for your change)'`
6. Push your branch on your GitHub repository. `git push origin (name of your
   branch)`
7. Click on your branch on GitHub and click the **Compare / pull request**
   button to send a pull request.

### How to make additional changes in a pull request

You simply need to push additional commits on the appropriate branch of your
GitHub repository. That's basically the same steps as above, except you don't
need to re-create the branch and the pull request.

**

When submitting a pull request, please take required time to discuss your
changes and adapt your work. It is generally a good practice to split unrelated
changes into separate branches and pull requests.

### How to reset and update your master branch with latest upstream changes

1. Fetch upstream changes. `git fetch upstream`
2. Checkout to your master branch. `git checkout master`
3. Replace your master branch by the upstream master branch. `git reset --hard
   upstream/master`
4. Replace your master branch on GitHub. `git push origin master -f`
