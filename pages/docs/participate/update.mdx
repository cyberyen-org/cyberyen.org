### General Instructions

1. **Backup Your Wallet**: Before proceeding with any upgrade, it is crucial to backup your wallet. This ensures that your funds are safe in case something goes wrong during the upgrade process. To backup your wallet:
   * Open Cyberyen Core.
   * Go to "File" > "Backup Wallet".
   * Save the backup file to a secure location.

2. **Shut Down the Older Version**: Before upgrading, ensure that the older version of Cyberyen Core is completely shut down. This process might take a few minutes, especially for older versions.

2. **Run the Installer**: Double-click the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

#### Upgrading on macOS

1. **Download the Latest Version**: Visit [cyberyen.org](https://cyberyen.org) to download the latest macOS version.
2. **Replace the Application**: Open the downloaded .dmg file and drag the updated Cyberyen-Qt application to your Applications folder, replacing the existing version.

#### Upgrading on Linux

2. **Replace the Binaries**: Extract the downloaded archive and copy over the new `cyberyend` and `cyberyen-qt` binaries to your Cyberyen directory, replacing the old binaries.

### Data Directory and Compatibility

#### Data Directory

* **Compatibility**: The blockchain and wallet files in the data directory are generally compatible between versions. Therefore, there is typically no need to alter the data directory when upgrading.
* **Automatic Upgrades**: Occasionally, the format of these files changes. The new version of Cyberyen Core includes code to automatically upgrade the files to the new format, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

#### Special Cases

* **Upgrading from Very Old Versions**: Sometimes, upgrading blockchain data files from very old versions to the new version is not supported. In such cases, it might be necessary to re-download the entire blockchain. Always check the release notes of the new version if you plan to upgrade from a very old version.
* **Downgrading**: Downgrading to an older version may not be possible due to changes in data file formats. Again, refer to the release notes for guidance if you are considering downgrading.
