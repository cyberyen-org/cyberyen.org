# Cyberyen Development

Cyberyen is an open-source project, welcoming contributions from developers worldwide. The complete source code and all necessary resources are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cyberyen). To contribute effectively, please follow the development process outlined in the README file and adhere to all coding guidelines.

### Development Discussion

Development discussions take place on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/cyberyen/projects?query=is%3Aopen) and [#cyberyen-dev](https://matrix.to/#/#cyberyen-dev:matrix.org) on Matrix. Active participation in these forums is encouraged to stay updated and collaborate with other developers.

### Code Review

Given the critical nature of Cyberyen Core as security software, all code changes must undergo thorough review by experienced developers.

* **Review Process**: Reviews can take time. Be patient and respectful of reviewers' time, as they are also managing their own projects.
* **Contribution**: Help review other contributors' pull requests. While expertise in Cyberyen, the Cyberyen Core codebase, or C++ is beneficial, it is not mandatory. Check for [open pull requests](https://github.com/cyberyen/cyberyen/pulls) that any developer can review.

### Getting Started

If you are new to Cyberyen Core development, here are ways to contribute:
